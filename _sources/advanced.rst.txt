Advanced topics
===============

.. _advanced:

In the lecture, we look at `the notebook <https://janboone.github.io/municipality_healthcare_expenditure/Municipality_data.html>`_ which you can `download here <https://janboone.github.io/municipality_healthcare_expenditure/Municipality_data.ipynb>`_.

This notebook and the resources below should give you some inspiration of what you can do for your python assignment.


Python assignment
-----------------

See :ref:`this page <assignment>` for details on the assignment.


Python topics
-------------

With python there is a lot of stuff you can do. Feel free to roam the
web to find something that you need/like.

Below we give some more resources for making plots with `plotly. <https://plot.ly/>`_

The idea of the advanced topics is that you figure them out
yourself. We will give a short introduction and some resources that
you can consult. But feel free to google for more
information/tutorials.

As new open source software is added continuously, it is important
that you are able to absorb these new things as they come along. That
is, do not feel obliged to stick to the things that we taught you more explicitly
during this course.


Plotly
------

In the introduction to python, we showed you how to make
figures with `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_. These figures are
perfect for a paper in pdf that people print to read. But when you
communicate via notebooks and/or html or give a presentation, you can
include interactive graphs. Plotly is a great way to make interactive
graphs. You need to have a (free) subscription to use plotly.

There are a number of tutorials on the web. One that I liked can be
found `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F_kkf7CDQs>`_

Use the :ref:`github <github1>` skills you learned here to clone their github
`repository <https://github.com/plotly/pycon-2015>`_. This gives you
the notebooks they use in their presentation and lets you play around
with them.

Make sure you run this `notebook
<https://github.com/plotly/pycon-2015/blob/master/00_my_first_plot.ipynb>`_
on your computer. It makes sure that your credentials are stored on
the computer that you use to make the plots. You cannot access their
server from the notebooks on your computer without these
credentials. This only needs to be done once.


Some advanced topics

You can download `this notebook
<https://janboone.github.io/applied-economics/_downloads/Advanced_Topics.ipynb>`_ for some further ideas of things to do with python.

Schedule for the course
=======================

questions
---------

If you have questions/comments about this course, go to the `issues
page <https://github.com/janboone/applied-economics/issues>`_
open a new issue (with the green "New issue" button) and type your
question. Use a title that is informative (e.g. not "question", but
"question about the second assignment"). Go to the next box ("Leave a comment")
and type your question. Then click on "Submit new issue". We will
answer your question as quickly as possible.

The advantages of the issue page include:

* if you have a question, other students may have it as well; in this
  way we answer the questions in a way that everyone can see it. Also
  before asking the question, you may want to check whether it was
  asked/answered before on the issue page
* we answer your question more quickly than when you email us
* you increase your knowledge of github!

Only when you need to include privately sensitive information ("my cat
has passed away"), you can send an email.

In order to post issues, you need to create a github account (which
you need anyway to follow this course).

Note that if your question is related to another issue, you can react
to the earlier issue and leave a comment in that "conversation".

python datacamp
---------------

The Python datacamp column refers to the following website:
`<https://www.datacamp.com/home#tab_python-courses>`_. For this
course, you only need to follow the first course "Intro to Python for
Data Science". This course is free of charge.

To follow the course, you do not need to install python on your
computer; you simply work in your webbrowser. Look at the videos and
do the exercises. Following the planning in the datacamp column makes
sure that you are up-to-date for the first python lecture in
November. During the lectures before November, no reference to python
is made.

If you prefer to use another introduction to python (e.g. using a
book); feel free to do so. Make sure that you cover the same topics as
the ones on datacamp.

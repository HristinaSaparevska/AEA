Final assignment
================

.. _assignment:


For this assignment, you create an ipython/jupyter notebook which has extension ".ipynb". You publish this notebook on GitHub and add a link to your README file (created in assignment 1, and in the repository reported in the google form) so that we can find it. Note that when someone views the notebook on GitHub (with a decent browser), it is actually rendered as if the person is running python.


The idea of the assignment is that you can report your findings in a
transparent way that can easily be verified/reproduced by others.


Example assignment: http://janboone.github.io/Deductible_Health_Insurance/

The python notebook here is more elaborate than what we expect you to
do. However, the following ingredients will be important when we
evaluate your assignment:


* Start with a clear and transparent *question*.
* There are a lot of interesting economic questions for which you do
  not need programming to find the answer. However, as an important
  part of this course is programming in python, we want to see some
  programming. So choose a question where you can show off your
  programming skills!
* Briefly *motivate* why this question is interesting.
* Explain the *method* that you use to answer the question.
* Give the *answer* that you find.
* Mention the main *assumptions* that you need to get this answer.
* When you use information, create a link to this information. The
  reader then only needs to click to find the relevant information.
* If you use data, present graphs of the data.
* If you use equations, use latex to make them easy to read.
* Explain your code, the reader must be able to easily follow what you
  are doing.
* Present a clear conclusion/answer to your question.
* Programming is great to do *sensitivity analysis*, just to the same
  you did before, but now with different parameter values.
* Include some *discussion* of what you find and elements on which you
  need additional information.
* To increase readability, use internal links. E.g. when you refer to the conclusion,
  create a link to it so that the reader can quickly glance what you
  have done and go back to where she/he was reading. For this to work, you need to export the notebook to html. You do not have to do this, but it will impress us if you manage it.

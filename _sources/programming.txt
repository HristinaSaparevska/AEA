Introduction to python
----------------------

In the lecture, we first use `this notebook
<https://janboone.github.io/applied-economics/_downloads/Intro_to_python_for_economists.html>`_ as a simple introduction.
If you want, you can download `the notebook
<https://janboone.github.io/applied-economics/_downloads/Intro_to_python_for_economists.ipynb>`_.

Then we look at how python can help to `solve models <https://janboone.github.io/municipality_healthcare_expenditure/solving_model.html>`_
which can also `download <https://janboone.github.io/municipality_healthcare_expenditure/solving_model.ipynb>`_.


Python as programming language
------------------------------

We use python as programming language. I guess, a fair question is:
why python? The non-scientific answer is: because I like it a lot.

Other answers, better motivated than my own, include:

* `<https://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html>`_
* `<http://blog.monitor.us/2014/10/why-python-is-becoming-so-popular/>`_
* `<http://cyrille.rossant.net/why-using-python-for-scientific-computing/>`_
* `<https://sites.google.com/site/pythonforscientists/python-vs-matlab>`_
* google the question if you want more answers.

We will program python using the ipython or jupyter notebook.
One motivation to use the ipython notebook is based on a paper in the AER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP9Qcjq8UVI
Note that this is a presentation on a python conference having nothing to do with
economics. The fact that this presentation uses an AER paper to
motivate using the notebook, may induce a wee pause in which you
ponder the state of our discipline.


After this pause, take a look at some notebooks:

`<https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks>`_


Links and resources for python:

Recall that for this lecture you are supposed to have followed the `datacamp
course. <https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-1-python-basics?ex=1>`_

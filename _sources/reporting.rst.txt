Reporting your results
======================


Here we discuss ways to report results on the web. Markdown,
Restructuredtext, Latex

Lecture can be :download:`downloaded <markdown_github.html>` or `opened in browser <https://janboone.github.io/applied-economics/_downloads/markdown_github.html>`_


Markdown
--------

For the first assignment it is useful to know a bit of markdown. You can
either google "markdown tutorial" or use one of the following websites:

- `<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_
- `<https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>`_
- `<https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/>`_


Also note that once you know how to work with markdown, it becomes
easy to make presentations in html. See for instance:
`<http://pandoc.org/demo/example9/producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc.html>`_. This
you can try at home! But for the course it is optional. If you want to
make an html presentation, you need to install pandoc (and latex, if
you want to use equations). Both pandoc and latex are :ref:`optional
<optionalinstall>` on the :ref:`installation page <install>`.

If you want to see an example of this. Look at the github repository
`<https://github.com/janboone/Private_contracts_health_care/tree/gh-pages>`_
which contains the markdown file of a presentation (hence you can
copy/clone this). The presentation then looks as follows:

`<http://janboone.github.io/Private_contracts_health_care/presentation_Toulouse.html#/>`_

Hence, when you give your presentation, you only need a browser and
the address of the presentation.

If you want to experiment a bit with this, download :download:`the zip
file <markdown_presentation.zip>`. Unzip this file and open the
markdown file presentation.md. The file also gives the commands to
create html or pdf presentations from the markdown file.

Note that to edit a markdown file, you use the editor you installed before.


Latex
-----

For the python assignment it is useful to familiarize yourself with
latex. Note that you do not need to type a whole document in latex (so
don't worry about preambles etc.), you just need to know how to type
\\(x^2\\), \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) or have math displayed like

\\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\\end{equation}

Google "latex tutorial" or go to pages like:

* `<http://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf>`_
* `<http://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/beginners/lesson-4/>`_
* `<http://www.andy-roberts.net/writing/latex/mathematics_1>`_

and focus on typesetting.

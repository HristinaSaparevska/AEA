Note that after assignment 1, we expect you to be able to work with github. If not, read one of the tutorials on git and github online.

The error message that students got in previous years is something like "Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind". You can google this error message. Examples of answers can be found `here <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10298291/cannot-push-to-github-keeps-saying-need-merge>`_  and `here as well <http://www.betterwaytoweb.com/how-to-use-github-a-tutorial-for-beginners/>`_.

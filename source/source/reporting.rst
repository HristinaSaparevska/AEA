Here we discuss ways to report results on the web using Markdown and Latex.

Lecture can be :download:`downloaded <markdown_github.html>` or `opened in browser <https://janboone.github.io/applied-economics/_downloads/markdown_github.html>`_


Markdown
--------

For the assignment it is useful to know a bit of markdown. You can
either google "markdown tutorial" or use one of the following websites:

- `<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_
- `<https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>`_

Latex
-----

For the python assignment it is useful to familiarize yourself with
latex. Note that you do not need to type a whole document in latex (so
don't worry about preambles etc.), you just need to know how to type
\\(x^2\\), \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) or have math displayed like

\\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\\end{equation}

Google "latex tutorial" or go to pages like:

* `<http://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf>`_
* `<http://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/beginners/lesson-4/>`_
* `<http://www.andy-roberts.net/writing/latex/mathematics_1>`_

and focus on typesetting.

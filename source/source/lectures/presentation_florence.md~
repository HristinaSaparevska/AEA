Introduction
============

motivation
----------

- insurers contract selectively to exclude inefficient health care providers

    - high costs and/or low quality

- when buying insurance, consumers cannot observe provider quality and costs

    - need to be "guided" by their insurer

- Dutch ministry of health is trying to "stimulate" selective
contracting
- selective contracting also popular in the US to reduce health care
costs

-----------


- but some people worry about effect on quality

    - insurers contract cheap low quality providers (LA Times,
    Sept. 2013, NYT July 2014)

> We are nervous about these narrow networks. It was all about
> price. But at what cost in terms of quality?

- question: do insurers (only) exclude socially inefficient providers?


what we know
------------

- selective contracting helps to reduce costs (Dranove et al. 1993,
Dranove 2000, Chernew and Newhouse 2011)

    - exclude expensive providers that insured patients would visit

- effect on quality not clear

    - insured is interested in quality; provider choice can help 
    - evidence is mixed (Cutler 2004, Porter and Teisberg 2006,
      Zwanziger et al. 2000)


framework
---------

- two providers
- provider $i$ offers $q_i - c_i$
- insurers observe $q_i,c_i$
- when buying insurance, consumers cannot observe $q_i,c_i$
- with insurance, patient does not care about $c_i$
- patient chooses highest quality provider from network

    - primary physician
    - word of mouth

- can insurer signal quality through selective contracting?


----------

- we want patient to be treated by $\max_i \{q_i-c_i\}$

- *insurer critical* configuration: $q_1-c_1>q_2-c_2$ but $c_1>c_2$

    - if insurer chooses, inefficient outcome: quality too low
    - selective contracting focuses on costs


- *patient critical* configuartion: $q_1>q_2$ but $q_1-c_1<q_2-c_2$

    - if patient chooses, inefficient outcome: costs too high


- we need exclusive outcome in latter and common outcome in former
case

- is this possible?


literature
----------

- theory on selective contracting/managed care

    - focus on effects on prices, treatments, adverse selection, not on
      quality
    - Cutler et al. (2000), Ma and McGuire (2002), McGuire (2011),
      Bardey and Rochet (2010) 

- I.O. literature on exclusive contracts

    - Rey and Tirole (2007) overview
    - we follow Bernheim and Whinston (1998)
	- always exists equilibrium in exclusive contracts
	- equilibrium in common contracts exists only if industry profits
      with common contracts exceeds profits with exclusive contracts


summary
-------

- selective contracting signals focus on costs
- high quality can only be signalled with common contracts
- monopoly insurer is efficient if cost difference is small compared
to quality difference
- always exists efficient equilibrium with insurer competition
- selective contracting is "good" if you think that

    - quality and costs are negatively correlated ("management")
    - medical arms race is real phenomenon

- selective contracting is "bad" if

    - quality has its cost



Model
=====


providers
---------

- providers $P_1,P_2$
- treatment quality $q^h,q^l$
- treatment costs $c^h,c^l$
- probability $f(q^1,c^1,q^2,c^2)$
- assume $q^h-c^h > q^l -c^l$: insurer critical configuration
- make (private) offers to insurers: $p^E,t^E,p^C,t^C$
- fee for service and capitation
- efficient provider: highest $q^i-c^i$



insurers
--------

- accept one or two contracts from providers
- announce premium $\sigma$ and network
- pay capitation $t$ to provider(s) and $p$ if insured needs treatment
- assume no co-payments


consumer
--------

- needs one treatment with probability (normalized to) 1
- buys insurance to get access to care; outside option 0
- insurance covers all costs
- hence values insurance at $E(q)$ when buying it
- *ex ante*: consumer does not observe $q^i,c^i$ nor contracts
- expected quality takes on two values: either $q^E$ or $q^C$
- Bayesian updating
- *ex post*: patient chooses highest quality provider from network


Monopoly insurer
================

exclusion
---------

- there is always an exclusive equilibrium
- insurer accepts contract with lowest price

    - if both offer same price, highest quality
    - with same price, same quality: randomizes

- with $c_1 \leq c_2$: $p=c_2,t=0$
- $\sigma^E = q^E$
- quality is $q^h$ except when

    - $q^l,c^l,q^h,c^h$
    - both providers have $q^l$

- industry profits $\Pi^E = q^E - c_1$
- inefficient in insurer critical configuration


common
------

- to raise efficiency: common outcome in $q^l,c^l,q^h,c^h$
- BW: can only be sustained if $\Pi^C \geq \Pi^E$

    - if $\Pi^E > \Pi^C$, provider can offer insurer contract that
      make them both better off: $C$ cannot be sustained as equilibrium

- for some configurations both $E$ and $C$ lead to efficiency
- to get $\Pi^C \geq \Pi^E$

    - implement $C$ whenever it leads to $q^h$
    - $E$ when it leads to $q^l$
    - except in patient critical configuration $q^h,c^h,q^h,c^l$

- $q^C - q^E < q^h - q^l$

+-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+


(in)efficiency
--------------

- efficiency can be sustained iff $\Pi^C \geq \Pi^E$ in C outcomes
- iff $q^C - q^E \geq c^h - c^l$ in insurer critical configuration
- difference in consumer quality perception must be big enough to
  prevent deviation to cheapest provider
- holds for some parameter values, but not for all
- outcome with monopoly insurer can be inefficient if difference in
  quality perception is too small

    - not enough C to guarantee quality

- also exists an equilibrium with too much C: $q^C = q^h,q^E = q^l$


Insurer competition
===================

efficiency
----------

- there are two insurers
- Bertrand competition
- main result: with insurer competition, the efficient equilibrium
always exists
- intuition: signal is clearer with competition

    - with monopoly insurer: consumer cannot distinguish E due to
    patient critical configuration and due to deviation from C
	- with insurer competition: patient critical configuration both
    offer E
	- with deviation: one insurer offers C the other one E
	- consumers believe $\tilde q^C = q^h, \tilde q^E = q^l$


Dynamic efficiency
==================

monopoly
--------

- suppose providers can invest to raise quality from $q^l$ to $q^h$
- assume that an efficient (static) equilibrium exists
- with monopoly insurer there is under-investment in quality:

    - appropriability effect: consumer valuation goes up with $q^C -
    q^E < q^h -q^l$
	- signalling profit: low quality provider in C outcome does not
      treat anyone, but still earns a signalling profit

- in an equilibrium with only E, no incentive to raise quality

competition
-----------

- with insurer competition there is an equilibrium which is efficient
both from a static and a dynamic point of view

    - appropriability effect disappears: difference in consumer
    expectation between C and E equals $q^h-q^l$
	- signalling profit is competed down to 0


Policy implications
===================

selective contracting
---------------------

- there are multiple equilibria of the contracting game
- equilibrium played depends on insured's expectations of $q^E,q^C$
- when $q^C - q^E$ is big, networks can be too big

    - inefficiency in patient critical configuration

- "stimulating" selective contracting can be welfare enhancing

    - government should explain to insured that $q^E$ can be high

- multiple equilibria also explain shifts in contracting in the US

    - indemnity insurance with wide networks; aggressive selective
      contracting with narrow networks; managed care backlash



desirable?
----------


- stimulating selective contracting is welfare enhancing if:

    - either quality and costs negatively correlated
    - insurer critical configuration unlikely
    
        - well run hospitals have high quality and low costs
        - high quality implies that it is less likely that patient needs
          to come back (hence, low costs)

    - or medical arms race: high quality implies low surplus $q-c$
    - patient critical configuration likely


- stimulating selective contracting tends to reduce quality and
welfare if:

    - quality and costs positively correlated
    - quality has its cost

        - good staff is more expensive
        - latest equipment

    - insurer critical configuration likely

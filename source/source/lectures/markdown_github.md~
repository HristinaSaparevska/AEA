Introduction
================

this lecture
------------

* in this lecture, we look at:

    * typing texts in markdown and latex
    * pandoc
    * creating webpages on github
	* first assignment

Office and Word!
======================

eh, no
------

* you may think that Word is great for everything

    * it can do all that needs to be done
    * you have buttons all over the screen
	* it must be good because it is expensive!

* in fact, it is not so great:

    * it combines editing and word processing
    * unpleasant to type equations
    * focused on printing texts
    * you can add structure, but you are not forced to

markdown
--------

* markdown allows you to create structure in a simple way
* examples are:

```

    this is a heading
    =================

    subheading
    ----------

    * first bullet
    * second bullet

    [link text](actual link, e.g. http://www.etc)

    ![Alt text for image](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")

```

* look on the web for other syntax like footnotes etc.
* equations you can type in latex

latex
-----

* latex is great word processing software
* you should consider writing your thesis in latex
* but for now, we focus on writing math in latex
* you can guess what the following will do:

```
$x^2$, $\beta$, $\sqrt{9}$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\bar x$

\begin{equation}

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

\end{equation}

```

* if you need something, just google; e.g. "google latex phi" or
  "google latex empty set" etc.

pandoc
------

* with pandoc you can convert markdown files into many other file
  formats
* for this course, you will convert markdown into html or pdf
* [pandoc website](http://pandoc.org/demos.html) contains examples of
  how to convert from one file format into another
* these commands can be quite elaborate
* the command to turn the markdown version of this presentation into
  an html file is given by


```
pandoc -s --mathjax --slide-level 2 --toc --toc-depth=1 -t revealjs markdown_github.md -V theme=solarized -o markdown_github.html

```


github
------

* github 




first assignment

Final assignment
================

.. _assignment:

* The python assignment you can do alone or with at max. one other
  student (i.e. max group size is 2).
* for the deadline for the python assignment, see :ref:`the page with the schedule <grade>`
* `download the assignment template <https://janboone.github.io/applied-economics/_downloads/assignment_template.ipynb>`_
* create a jupyter notebook which has extension ".ipynb". You publish
  this notebook on GitHub and add a link to your README file (created
  in assignment 1, and in the repository reported in the google form)
  so that we can find it. Note that when someone views the notebook on
  GitHub (with a decent browser), it is actually rendered as if the
  person is running python (with some exceptions like plotly graphs).

The idea of the assignment is that you report your findings in a
transparent way that can easily be verified/reproduced by others.

The following ingredients will be important when we
evaluate your assignment:

* Start with a clear and transparent *question*.
* There are a lot of interesting economic questions for which you do
  not need programming to find the answer. However, as an important
  part of this course is programming in python, we want to see some
  programming. So choose a question where you can show off your
  programming skills!
* Briefly *motivate* why this question is interesting.
* Explain the *method* that you use to answer the question.
* Give the *answer* that you find.
* Mention the main *assumptions* that you need to get this answer.
* When you use information, create a link to this information. The
  reader then only needs to click to find the relevant information.
* If you use data, present graphs of the data.
* If you use equations, use latex to make them easy to read.
* Explain your code, the reader must be able to easily follow what you
  are doing.
* Present a clear conclusion/answer to your question.
* Programming is great to do *sensitivity analysis*, just do the same
  you did before, but now with different parameter values.
* Include some *discussion* of what you find and elements on which you
  need additional information.
* To increase readability, use internal links. E.g. when you refer to
  the conclusion, create a link to it so that the reader can quickly
  glance what you have done and go back to where she/he was
  reading. For this to work, you need to export the notebook to
  html. You do not have to do this, but it will impress us if you
  manage it.

We will have some guest lectures of people using python in the real
world. This you can use as a starting point for your assignment. But
you can also make the assignment based on models you have seen in
other lectures; e.g. last year some students created a simulation
model that was discussed in their MSc track.

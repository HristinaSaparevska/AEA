First Assignment
================

.. _assignment1:



* create a github account at `github <https://github.com/>`_
* sign in with your new account and create a repository `assignments` (note that when creating the repository, click on "Initialize this repository with a README")
* use this README file in the repository to present us with the links to your assignments; like `here <https://github.com/janboone/assignments>`_
* fill in the `google form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRGBsM3QYzY0jEX1O4_q38kzb4VPQEW-qPVzl6fwPJwOBPzg/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=send_form>`_
* deadline for filling in the google form is: Tuesday September 20, 2016

* for the first assignment, you follow either of two routes

    * the simple way
    * the experienced way (to earn extra points)


simple way
----------

* the reason why this is "simple", is because everything happens on-line
* in the web-browser, go to your repository `assignments`
* make sure that you are signed in (with your github account)
* click on the button `create new file`
* as the name of this new file, type `CV.md`
* Below `<> Edit new file` start typing markdown
* every now and again, you can type `Preview` to see what it looks like
* make sure to save your work regularly

    * by pressing the `Commit new file` button at the bottom
    * you can add a message explaining what you change in each "commit"

* as an example of such a CV --in progress-- see `this one <https://github.com/janboone/assignments/blob/master/CV.md>`_
* once you are finished, copy the web address of your CV into the README file, as I have done `here <https://github.com/janboone/assignments>`_

experienced way
---------------

* this is "experienced" because you will be working off-line on your computer to do this (not on-line)
* this means you have to clone your repository to your computer
* create/edit the file CV.md
* using pandoc you can turn this markdown file into an html file
* for this conversion you can use CV-style files (use google to find these)
* or you can use the "buttondown files" from the applied economics page
* follow the `Command line` instructions at `this page <https://janboone.github.io/applied-economics/github.html>`_
* in the README file add two links: one link to markdown version of your CV (`CV.md`) and the other link to the html version (`CV.html`) published on the gh-pages branch

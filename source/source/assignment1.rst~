First Assignment
================

.. _assignment1:



For the assignment, do the following:
  
* Copy the :ref:`buttondown files <buttondown>` that you downloaded
  before.
* Edit the file "pandoc_example.md" such that it becomes
  your CV. A CV has your name at the top, well I guess you know what a
  CV is... To edit the markdown file, use the (markdown) editor you installed.
* Convert your CV into html using pandoc and the stylesheet
  buttondown.css.
* Publish your CV both in html and in markdown on github.
* Make sure that you have filled in the webform (address can be found on blackboard) so that we know the address of your github repository. If we do not have your address, we cannot grade the assignment!


This assignment you make on your own: not in a group!
  
Note that --in case you want to show off-- there are stylesheets
especially made to render CV's in html. Google, for instance,
"markdown CV".

There is no need to do this. But if you manage to do this for the
assignment, we will be very impressed!

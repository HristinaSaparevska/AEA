Introduction to python
----------------------

The simplest way to get access to the material that we use, is to clone `this repository <https://github.com/janboone/python_economics>`_

You can follow this link and click on "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP". Once the zip-file is on your computer, you can unzip it. Then navigate towards it in the jupyter notebook to open the relevant file.

The more sophisticated approach is to open a shell/terminal/command prompt and type: "git clone https://github.com/janboone/python_economics"

This creates a directory "programming_notebooks" on your computer with all the relevant files.


Python as programming language
------------------------------

We use python as programming language. I guess, a fair question is:
why python? The non-scientific answer is: because I like it a lot.

Other answers, better motivated than my own, include:

* `<https://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html>`_
* `<http://blog.monitor.us/2014/10/why-python-is-becoming-so-popular/>`_
* `<http://cyrille.rossant.net/why-using-python-for-scientific-computing/>`_
* `<http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html>`_
* google the question if you want more answers.

We will program python using the jupyter notebook.
One motivation to use the jupyter notebook is based on a paper in the AER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP9Qcjq8UVI
Note that this is a presentation on a python conference having nothing to do with
economics. The fact that this presentation uses an AER paper to
motivate using the notebook, may induce a wee pause in which you
ponder the state of our discipline.

After this pause, take a look at some notebooks:

Installing the stuff
====================

.. _install:

*Disclaimer*: below we describe the software that you need to
install for this course. Although we are not aware of any problems with these
programs, we cannot accept responsibility in case anything goes wrong
with your computer. Also, when you use this software, make sure
to save regularly and back up your work.

You only need to install this software if you choose the python assignment for this course.

We need to install quite some software. This will be a bit of work and
things are bound to go wrong. So switch on some music_ and go ahead!

This is the first hurdle that you need to take to use open source
software. If you get an error message during installation, copy the
error message and google it. In 99 percent of the cases this will
solve your problem. If not; ask us in class.




Required installs for this course:
----------------------------------

Installing the software is a bit of work which takes quite some time (for your computer, not for you). Stay with it; once you are done, you are all set for the course. If you have problems with one piece of software that you cannot resolve, simply go on with the next. The more you manage to install the better; remaining issues we sort out in class.

* As we will be working with GitHub_, it is useful to install Git_.

  * if you need more help here,
	`<http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_
	may be useful and
	`<http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup>`_.

* Windows has a command-prompt_ installed by default. It is probably
  not the best terminal you can use. Here is a discussion of better
  consoles_ for windows. Note that the last link points to
  stackoverflow_; a website that you will be visiting a lot in the
  coming weeks!
* If you have a Mac, the application you need is called Terminal. But
  you may want to install iTerm2_, as it is more fancy and easier to
  work with.
* The program language that we use for this course is python_ which we
  will use with the ipython_ or `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_
  notebook interface. The best way to install all this together is to
  use the anaconda_ distribution. Make sure to install python 3.X. If
  for some reason you cannot get anaconda installed, ask us in class
  and we will help. As an alternative you can choose canopy_. If even
  that gives problems, you can also work in the cloud with
  `<https://mindaro.uvt.nl/>`_. This link only works as long as you
  are a TiU student. Another disadvantage of this is that you cannot
  install packages yourself.

  
If you have installed all this: congratulations, you are done! If you experienced any problems, ask us in class. Below we give some software resources, that you can install; but you do not have to do this.

* You can install Latex_. Latex is great to write your MSc thesis
  in. For this course, you need it if you want to export a jupyter notebook and display math in html.
* Further, you can install Pandoc_. Pandoc is an incredible piece of software. It
  allows you to easily move between different formats. See the demos_
  on the Pandoc website. Nowadays it is useful to be able to publish in html, but the
  last thing you want is to actually type html. With Pandoc you don't
  need to. You type in an "easy" language like Markdown_ or
  reStructuredText_ and then convert to html (or reveal.js_ to make a
  presentation).

Once you really get into open source, you will be editing (plain) text files. Clearly, you can use MS Word
or other office type software to do this, but this is not recommended
(you probably guessed this). Most operating systems have a simple
editor installed, like notepad on Windows. This may be a bit "too
basic".

You can install different editors for different purposes.

* For Latex on Windows, winedt_ is a popular choice.
* Others like TeXworks_.
* A Markdown editor for Windows is: MarkdownPad_. On Mac you can use:
  MacDown_ or Mou_. You can also google "markdown editor" and then add
  your operating system to the query.

Alternatively, you can install an editor that can deal with any
file. That is, the editor recognizes what type of file you are editing
and adapts its behaviour accordingly. Basically, there are two popular
editors that can do this and there is a war_ between them.

* Emacs_ is a great editor. It has a bit of a learning curve; but hey,
  you are young! Plenty of time for this investment to pay off. There
  are lots of introductions to emacs on the web. Just google something
  like "emacs tutorial" and you can choose your favourite one. If you
  are wondering which emacs to install for your operating system, this
  page may help: which-emacs_. Personally, I use emacs. But there are
  lots of people who prefer:
* vi_ as editor. Most people install vim_. Also here there are lots of
  tutorials on the web.

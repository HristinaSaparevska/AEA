Schedule for the course
=======================

questions
---------

If you have questions/comments about this course, go to the `issues
page <https://github.com/janboone/applied-economics/issues>`_
open a new issue (with the green "New issue" button) and type your
question. Use a title that is informative (e.g. not "question", but
"question about the second assignment"). Go to the next box ("Leave a comment")
and type your question. Then click on "Submit new issue". We will
answer your question as quickly as possible.

The advantages of the issue page include:

* if you have a question, other students may have it as well; in this
  way we answer the questions in a way that everyone can see it. Also
  before asking the question, you may want to check whether it was
  asked/answered before on the issue page
* we answer your question more quickly than when you email us
* you increase your knowledge of github!

Only when you need to include privately sensitive information ("my cat
has passed away"), you can send an email.

In order to post issues, you need to create a github account (which
you need anyway to follow this course).

Note that if your question is related to another issue, you can react
to the earlier issue and leave a comment in that "conversation".

Your main choice is:

* whether to do either the canon or python

There is no need to follow the lectures of the option you have not chosen. To illustrate, if you choose, say, the canon (taught by Sjak), you do not need to attend the python lectures (taught by Jan). If you do attend the python lectures, bring your laptop so that you can work along with the notebooks in class.


python datacamp
---------------

The Python datacamp column refers to the following website:
`<https://www.datacamp.com/home#tab_python-courses>`_. For this
course, you need to follow the courses:

+ `Intro to Python for Data Science <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science>`_
+ `Intermediate Python for Data Science <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science>`_
+ `Pandas foundation <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations>`_


You need to sign up for datacamp via the google-form that we provide. In this way: (i) we can monitor your progress (to see whether you finish your assignments in time; see Python grade below) and (ii) you have access to all datacamp courses free of charge (also the ones that you usually have to pay for).

To follow the datacamp course, you do not need to install python on your
computer; you simply work in your webbrowser. Look at the videos and
do the exercises. Following the planning in the datacamp column makes
sure that you are up-to-date for the python lectures.



grade
-----

.. _grade:

Your grade is determined as follows:

* you chose whether you want to do either the canon or python, the assignments associated with either of these is your final grade.


**Python grade:**

* there are two datacamp assignments with deadlines:

  * `Intermediate Python for Data Science <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science>`_
  * `Pandas foundations <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations>`_
  * you receive 1 point for each datacamp assignment that you finish in time
  * see `the schedule <schedule.html>`_ and Datacamp for the deadlines

* you do a final assignment with which you can earn at max. 8 points.
* Hence, your overall grade if you do the Python track is at max. 10 points.

The final python assignment, you can --but you do not have to-- do with one other student.

The deadline for the final python assignment is: Thursday January 31st, 2019. However, if you need your grade before the end of January, you need to submit your final assignment by Thursday January 17th, 2019. Let us know by email that your assignment needs to be graded early.

The resit deadline for the python assignment is: Thursday August 15th, 2019. Let us know by email that you have submitted your assignment for the resit.
